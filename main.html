            Inception follows Dom Cobb, a skilled thief who specializes in the art of extracting valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state. Cobb is offered a chance to have his criminal history erased if he can successfully perform "inception" — the act of planting an idea into someone’s mind.
